# AWS Container Security Survey 2020

Following [last year's survey](https://github.com/mhausenblas/aws-container-security-survey-2019), in 2020 we will again ask you questions around good practices and uptake of tools and methodologies concerning security of your container workloads on AWS.

Overall, the plan is as follows:

* 06/2020: [Survey Questions CfP](#call-for-participation-survey-questions)
* 07-09/2020: [Survey](#survey)
* 10/2020: [Results](#results)

## Call for Participation: Survey Questions

Until end of June 2020 we ask you to comment on the proposed questions and/or submit suggestions for questions or topics to you want us to cover. You can either directly create a pull request against the [questions](questions.md) or raise an [issue](https://github.com/mhausenblas/aws-container-security-survey-2020/issues) with a suggestion for a topic we should consider. Note that the scope of the topic is container security.

In early July the questions will be finalized and published here.

## Survey

The survey itself runs from early July (as soon as the questions are finalized) until end of September. We ask you to help spread the word. Ideally we get 1000 or more people to respond to the survey.

## Results

 We plan to publish the results of the survey including the raw data by October 2020.
