Following [last year's](https://github.com/mhausenblas/aws-container-security-survey-2019) survey, in 2020 we will again ask you questions around good practices and uptake of tools and methodologies concerning container security.

Overall, the plan is as follows:

1. Call for Participation: during June 2020 we ask you to comment on the questions and/or submit suggestions for questions or topics to be completed. Early July the questions will be finalized.
1. The survey itself runs from mid July to September.
1. We plan to publish the results of the survey including the raw data by October 2020.
